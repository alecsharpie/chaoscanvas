Hey R1!

Can you please help me add some conceptual chaos to the world? I want to invoke a mind bending optical illusion of a webpage (with a HTML & JS canvas).

Here is my current code:
script.js
```
...
```

Can you please help me brainstorm, plan out, and then execute on an upgrade to this code? I want to make it more chaotic, bringing forth a feeling of real randomness while invoking awe! I really am hoping to also keep is satisfying, so not to flashy etc.

Thank you so much R1!
